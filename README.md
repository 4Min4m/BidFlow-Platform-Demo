# BidFlow Self-Service Platform Demo

This project demonstrates a mini Internal Developer Platform (IDP) for self-service deployment and monitoring of a simple bidding microservice. Built with Kubernetes on GCP, Terraform for IaC, GitOps CI/CD, and observability tools.

## Overview
- **App**: Ruby/Go microservice simulating auction bids stored in Redis.
- **Platform Features**: Self-service Helm deploys, auto-scaling, log parsing for anomalies.
- **KPIs Measured**: Deployment time reduction, MTTR for incidents.
- **Collaboration Sims**: AI role-play transcripts with team members.
