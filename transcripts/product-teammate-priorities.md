Q : For the bidding microservice, what key priorities (e.g., low-latency for real-time bids, A/B testing variants)? How to integrate simple A/B (e.g., different Redis TTLs for bid expiration)? Keep collaborative and ask questions back.

A: Key priorities for the bidding microservice:

1. Low latency and consistency – Users expect instant feedback and reliable bid ordering. We need to decide whether to optimize for speed (UX) or strict consistency. Redis caching and async persistence via Kafka can introduce trade-offs.

2. High availability under load – During peak bidding, Redis could serve as a fast buffer, while Kafka ensures durability. We should define which component is the source of truth.

3. A/B testing and experimentation – For example, testing different Redis TTLs. We must decide whether to run experiments at the API layer (via feature flags) or the frontend (Next.js variants). Results must be tagged and monitored separately.

4. Monitoring and alerting – Key metrics include bid latency, Redis hit/miss ratios, Kafka lag, and error rates. We’ll need these to compare A/B variants.

Example A/B test idea:

* Variant A: TTL = 30s
* Variant B: TTL = 120s
  Keys include experiment IDs, and background jobs handle expired bids.
  We must consider fairness (different TTLs may affect perceived reliability) and define whether the experiment targets bid storage or bid evaluation logic.
