Q: What Ruby version should we target for the microservice (based on common stacks like Rails 7)? How does garbage collection work in Ruby vs. Go, and any tuning tips for high-traffic auctions?

A: If we're aligning with a Rails 7-based ecosystem, Ruby 3.2.x is currently the safest bet.

Q: Do any internal gems or services depend on older Ruby?

A: No.
